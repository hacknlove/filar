# filar

Filar is a web framework, which goal is to be as close as possible to vanillajs, but with a little bit of sugar.

## WIP

At this moment it's just a proof of concept, that I am developing on live sessions.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Approach

This is going to be very agile. No planning or anything. 

The framework will be developed alongside a web app using it, in the playground folder.

From this, the ideas about how the framework should be, will emerge.
